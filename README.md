# Senior_Design_Project
Structural Failure Detection System.
This was the Design Project I did in my senior year. 
Our goal was to create a system that could detect a change in the physical charatersitics of a complicated solid using vibrations.
This was acheived by creating a neueral network that was trained to detect a change in the vibrational response of an object.
